UPDI Protocol
Low Level Decoder for Saleae Logic 2 Software

## UPDI Protocol
The UPDI Protocol is used my MicroChip for their ATTINY Series of AVR 8 Bit Microcontrollers.

This was build and tested specifically for the ATTINY 1616.  It may or may not work with any other part.  I prototyped first with the Adafruit ATTINY 1616 Seesaw board, and then integrated the ATTINY1616 directly into my own PCB design.
